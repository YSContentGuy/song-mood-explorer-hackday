# Song Mood Explorer - AI-Enhanced Music Recommendation System

An intelligent music recommendation engine that understands the emotional and contextual needs of musicians. This system goes beyond traditional "comfort zone" algorithms by analyzing user behavior patterns, inferring moods from playing data, and providing personalized song suggestions based on time of day, practice goals, and emotional state.

**Why it's useful:** Instead of just recommending songs at your skill level, this system understands *why* you want to play music right now - whether you need energy, relaxation, challenge, or comfort - and finds songs that match both your technical ability and emotional needs.

## üéØ The Problem This Solves

Traditional music learning apps recommend songs based only on technical difficulty. But musicians have different needs:
- **Sometimes you want comfort** - familiar songs that feel safe and enjoyable
- **Sometimes you want challenge** - songs that push your boundaries and help you grow  
- **Sometimes you want energy** - upbeat songs to get you motivated
- **Sometimes you want calm** - peaceful songs for relaxation

This system analyzes your playing patterns to understand these needs and recommends songs that match both your skill level AND your emotional state.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd song-mood-explorer-hackday
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Create `.env` file with your configuration:
   ```bash
   # OpenAI API Key for AI mood analysis (recommended)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
   
   # LLM Configuration
   LLM_PROVIDER=openai
   LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
   
   # Yousician API (optional)
   USE_REAL_API=false
   YOUSICIAN_API_KEY=your_yousician_api_key_here
   YOUSICIAN_BASE_URL=https://api.yousician.com

   USE_REAL_YS_DATA=true
   PORT=3000
   ```

4. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   # Development mode with auto-reload
   npm run dev
   
   # Production mode
   npm start
   ```

## Quick Demo

Experience the system's intelligent recommendations in action.

1) Install + run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

2) Open the interactive demo
```bash
http://localhost:3000/basic-demo.html
```

**What you'll see:** The demo showcases three different musician profiles with varying skill levels and learning styles. Click on each user to see how the system:
- **Infers their mood** from their playing patterns and preferences
- **Recommends songs** that match both their technical ability and emotional needs
- **Explains the reasoning** behind each recommendation with detailed scoring
- **Adapts to different learning styles** (comfort zone vs challenge seekers)

**Key insight:** Notice how the same song gets different scores for different users based on their individual needs and contexts.

## Offline Static Demo (No Server)

Build a self-contained HTML you can open directly in a browser.

- Use your CSV:
```
npm run build:story:csv
open public/story-static.html         # macOS
# or: start "" public\story-static.html   # Windows
```

- Use the bundled YS dataset:
```
npm run build:story
open public/story-static.html
```

This generates `public/story-static.html`, which shows the three users, their inferred mood/time/goal, and one suggested song each with a ‚ÄúWhy this song‚Äù line.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` ‚Äî start server at `http://localhost:3000`
- `npm run build:story` ‚Äî build static demo using bundled YS dataset
- `npm run build:story:csv` ‚Äî build static demo using `song metadata (2).csv`
