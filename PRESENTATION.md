## üî¨ Technical Deep Dive

### 1. Behavioral Signal Analysis
```javascript
// Engagement Classification
const engagementRatio = totalPlayTime / playCount;
const completionRate = averageSessionLength / songLength;

// Behavioral Types:
// - comfort_zone: High completion, frequent replays
// - persistent_challenge: Low completion, high persistence  
// - challenge_abandoned: Quick abandonment patterns
// - appropriate_challenge: Balanced engagement
```

### 2. Multi-Source Mood Scoring
```javascript
// Weighted Mood Calculation
moodScore = (ysTags * 0.4) + (behavioral * 0.3) + (llm * 0.2) + (enhanced * 0.1)

// Confidence Boosting
confidence = avgConfidence + (sourceCount * 0.1) // Multi-source bonus
```

### 3. Contextual Recommendation Engine
```javascript
// Context-Aware Scoring
finalScore = moodAlignment * timeOfDayWeight * energyFit * goalAlignment
```
